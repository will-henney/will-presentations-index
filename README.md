# Index to all my presentations

The idea is to have each presentation in a separate git repo, but on the local disk, they will all be organized under `~/Dropbox/Presentations/`


## Older presentations
Talks from 2011 to 2020 are all in one big repo: [`~/Dropbox/Presentations-2011-2020`](https://github.com/will-henney/will-presentations.git)

## Talks for the general public

These are stored in a different place. Most are in [`~/Dropbox/Public-Talks`](https://github.com/will-henney/public-talks.git)
